## __ATTENSION__

This Image is forked from [wiseio/datascience-docker](https://github.com/wiseio/datascience-docker). Please refer original repository.

Dockerized Notebook for (Pythonic) Data Science
======================

Docker container with Python data science tools (particularly, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, sklearn, scikit-image, nltk, gensim, psycopg2) the IPython notebook (single user). This is an autogenerated image using the public [wise.io](http://wise.io) datascience [git repo](https://github.com/wiseio/datascience-docker).

*This wise.io image is based off of the official [Dockerfiles from IPython](https://github.com/ipython/docker-notebook/tree/master/notebook), but using [Continuum/Anaconda](http://continuum.io) rather than bleeding-edge base containers.*

## Quickstart the Notebook Server

Set a few environment variables locally (add later to `.bash_profile` if you like):

```
export WISEDS_CODE_DIR="$(PWD)"           # or wherever you want to code
export WISEDS_DATA_DIR="$(PWD)/data"      # likewise.
export IPYTHON_PASSWORD=MakeAPassword # not this!
alias wiseds="docker run -d -p 80:8888 -v $(PWD):/workspace/ -v $(PWD)/data:/workspace/data -e "PASSWORD=$IPYTHON_PASSWORD" wiseio/datascience-base ; echo 'Now go to your browser: http://$(boot2docker ip). The password is $IPYTHON_PASSWORD' "
```

Assuming you have docker installed, run this to start up a notebook server over HTTPS.

```
docker run -d -p 80:8888 -v $WISEDS_CODE_DIR:/workspace/ -v $WISEDS_DATA_DIR:/workspace/data -e "PASSWORD=$IPYTHON_PASSWORD" wiseio/datascience-base
```

You'll now be able to access your notebook at https://localhost with password MakeAPassword (please change the environment variable above).

If you are on OSX, you'll need to know the name of your VM from boot2docker:

```
 boot2docker ip
```

You'll then connect via `http://<ip>`

## Using the Container ##

Once you're running the container, you can get a terminal window inside if needed:

```
docker exec -it <container_name> bash
```

Here you can add new functionality if you need it. E.g.,

```
apt-get package-name
pip install requirements.txt
...
```

Note that this will only add functionality into the container itself, not the image. If you want to use this new functionality, you'll want to add it to the image by hacking the Dockerfile.

## Hacking on the Dockerfile

Clone the repository from whence this image was made, make changes then build the container:

```
git clone https://github.com/wiseio/datascience-docker.git
cd datascience-docker
docker build -t  datascience-base .
docker run -d -p 80:8888 -e "PASSWORD=$(IPYTHON_PASSWORD)" datascience-base
```

## Use your own certificate
This image looks for `/key.pem`. If it doesn't exist a self signed certificate will be made. If you would like to use your own certificate, concatenate your private and public key along with possible intermediate certificates in a pem file. The order should be (top to bottom): key, certificate, intermediate certificate.

Example:

```
cat hostname.key hostname.pub.cert intermidiate.cert > hostname.pem
```

Then you would mount this file to the docker container:

```
docker run -v /path/to/hostname.pem:/key.pem -d -p 443:8888 -e "PASSWORD=pass" wiseio/datascience-base
```

## Using HTTPS
This docker image by default runs IPython notebook in HTTP.  If you'd like to run this in HTTPS,
you can use the `USE_HTTP` environment variable.  Setting it to zero enables HTTPS.

Example:

```
docker run -d -p 443:8888 -e "PASSWORD=$IPYTHON_PASSWORD" -e "USE_HTTP=0" wiseio/datascience-base

You'll then connect via https://<ip>`
```
